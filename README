This sample of PHP code is designed to show my ability working with the language, particularly it's Object Oriented capabilities.

Some aspects of coding with PHP that are covered include:

* Working with SPL_Autoload functionality to autoload classes.
* Using Namespaces
* Using a Factory to create objects
* Utilizing the Observer pattern to observe the functionality of an object.
* Using an anonymous function.
* Writing and running a test through PHPUnit
* Handling Exceptions with try/catch block
* Documenting code with DocBlocks

I've included a file to run the code on the command line, as well as a PHPUnit Test Case that effectively does the same thing.
